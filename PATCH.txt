How to Install a Sugar Patch
----------------------------

IMPORTANT! Before beginning the upgrade process, it is imperative 
to perform a backup of the Sugar directory structure and the database.

If you have customized parts of Sugar, please check for any patched files that
would overwrite your changes.

- Patches are now applied through the Upgrade Wizard panel under the Admin section.
- In short:
    - upload the zip file through the Upgrade Wizard
    - Click the 'Install' button to install the patch
