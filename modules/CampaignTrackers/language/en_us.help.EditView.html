<h1>Campaign Trackers</h1>
<p>You can use one or more tracker URLs in your campaign emails to track the response to your campaign. When recipients open the email and click on a URL link, the system, using an unique key identifier, track actions by each recipient.
<p>To create a campaign tracker, enter the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="helpButton">Tracker Name</span>. Enter a tracker name for your reference; use alpha-numeric characters.
<li><span class="helpButton">Tracker URL</span>. Enter the tracker URL; for example, http://www.sugarcrm.com.
<li><span class="helpButton">Opt-out Link </span> Select this box to embed your “Unsubscribe” instructions in a tracker URL. By default, the system uses the removeme.php file which contains these instructions, and displays this file name in the Tracker URL field.
</ul>
