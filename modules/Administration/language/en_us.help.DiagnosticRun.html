<h1>Diagnostic Tool</h1>

<p>Use this page to capture system configuration for diagnostics and analysis. The diagnostic tool pulls up various information about the system and stores it in a zip file on the server for download. When you send a help request to Customer Support, you can attach the file because it summarizes all the basic information required to resolve the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>To run the diagnostic tool, click <span class="helpButton"> Execute Diagnostic.</span>
<li>To capture specific configuration information, click the <span class="helpButton">Advanced</span> link below the Execute Diagnostic button. From the list of configuration files, 
select what you want to view and then click <span class="helpButton">Execute Diagnostic</span>. 
<br> The system creates a Zip file that you can save on your local machine.
