<h1>Scheduler</h1>

<p>Use this page to view existing jobs such as running reports and sending out campaign emails. The Scheduler integrates with external UNIX systems and Windows systems to run jobs that are scheduled through those systems, using either Cron (UNIX, Linux, BSD) or Schedule tasks (Windows). </p>
<p>The Scheduler Home page displays the following information:</p>
<ul>
A Search sub-panel where you can enter the account name to search for a specific account.
<p>You can schedule any of the following job types:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="helpButton">pollMonitoredInboxes.</span> This job monitors inbound Emails in active mailboxes that you set up using the Inbound Email option in the Email panel of the Admin page.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">runMassEmailCampaign.</span> This job processes the outbound email queue for your organization’s mass campaign Emails.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">pruneDatabase.</span> This job reads all the tables in your Sugar database, finds records that have been soft-deleted, creates a large SQL file, and physically deletes those records. This job enhances performance but is not essential to the use of Sugar. The backup files are placed in cache/backups with time-stamped filenames.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">pollMonitoredInboxesForBouncedEmailCampaigns.</span> This job polls any mailbox in which, the "Possible Actions" parameter is set to “Bounce Handling”. This is an essential component of monitoring mass email campaigns.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">processQueue.</span> This job runs reports and emails them to the user as per the schedule specified for a given report. The reports are sent to the user through an email from a PHP script that runs at regular intervals to send out the emails at the appropriate time. The user can choose which reports to receive and how often to send out reports.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Process Workflow.</span> This job processes workflow events. If you set a timed trigger for an event; for example, when a lead is a week old, then it finds the predefined Workflow actions and fires them when appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the detail page, click the appropriate button to edit, duplicate, or delete a job.</p>
