<h1>Target Lists</h1>
A target is an individual that you have some information on but does not qualify as a lead or contact. When you have multiple targets, you can group them into a target list according to a set of predetermined criteria such as age group or spending habits.
When you create a target list, you can specify one of the following types:
<ul>
<li><span class="helpButton">Default</span>. A list of people who are the campaign targets and receive the campaign email.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Seed</span>. A list of people who need to receive the campaign email but must not be tracked as potential leads.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Test</span>. A list of people who will receive a campaign email to test it before it is sent out to the default list.</li> 
<li><span class="helpButton">Suppression List.</span> A list of people you want excluded from the campaign email recipient list. Suppression lists can be by ID, email address, or domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a target list, enter the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="helpButton"> Name</span>. Enter a name for the target list.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Type</span>. From the drop-down list, select the target list type.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Assigned to</span>. Enter the name of the user assigned to this list; click <span class="helpButton">Select</span> to select from the User list. By default, it is assigned to you. </li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Team</span>. Enter the name of the team assigned to this list; click <span class="helpButton">Select</span> to select from the Team list. By default, it is assigned to you.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Description</span>. Enter a brief description of the target list.</li>
</ul>
Click<span class="helpButton">Save</span> to save the target list; click <span class="helpButton">Cancel</span> to exit the page without creating the list.</li>
