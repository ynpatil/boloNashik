<h1>Project Tasks</h1>

<p>Typically, a project consists of multiple tasks that must be completed satisfactorily to ensure success. In Sugar Suite, after you create a project, you can create tasks associated with it. </p>
<p>To create a project task, enter the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="helpButton">Name</span>. Enter a name for the task.
<li><span class="helpButton">Assigned to</span>. Enter the name of the user who has ownership of the task. By default it is assigned to you.



<li><span class="helpButton">Status</span>. From the drop-down list, select the current status of the task.
<li><span class="helpButton">Task Number</span>. Enter a number for the task. A task number uniquely identifies the task. You can refer to a task by its number instead of its name.
<li><span class="helpButton">Depends on</span>. From the drop-down list, select another task that will need to be completed before proceeding with this task.
<li><span class="helpButton">Priority</span>. From the drop-down list, select a priority level that reflects the importance of completing this task.
<li><span class="helpButton">Milestone</span>. Check this box if the completion on this task is considered a milestone for project completion.
<li><span class="helpButton">Order</span>. Enter a number to specify the sequence of the task in the list of project tasks. Specifying the order is useful when a task does not have any dependencies assigned to it. 
<li><span class="helpButton">Project</span>. From the drop-down list, select the project associated with the task.
<li><span class="helpButton">Progress</span>. Enter the percentage of the task that has been completed.
<li><span class="helpButton">Utilization</span>. From the drop-down list, select the number of work hours that a user should dedicate their work hours towards the assigned task. Only one person can be assigned to a given project task. 
<li><span class="helpButton">Start Date</span>. Click the Calender icon and select a start date for the task; enter the start time in the adjoining field.
<li><span class="helpButton">Estimated Efforts</span>. Enter the sum of estimated efforts for all project tasks.
<li><span class="helpButton">Due Date</span>. Click the Calender icon and select the due date for task completion; enter the end time in the adjoining field.
<li><span class="helpButton">Actual Efforts</span>. Enter the sum of actual efforts for all project tasks.
<li><span class="helpButton">Description</span>. Enter a brief description of the task.
</ul>
<p>Click <span class="helpButton">Save<span> to create the task; click <span class="helpButton">Cancel</span> to return to the project detail page without creating the task.
