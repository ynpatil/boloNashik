<h1>Dashboard</h1>

<p>Use the Dashboard module to view and manage charts based on custom and pre-defined reports. You can use these charts to view sales and opportunities for your organization. Each distinctively colored area on a chart is linked to the data set that it represents. You can click any colored area to drill down to the underlying data. </p>
<p>The Dashboard Home page displays a drop-down list from which you can select the chart that you want to view.</ul>
<p>The pre-defined charts are as follows:
<ul>
<li><span class="helpButton">Pipeline by Sales Stage</span>. A horizontal stacked bar chart where each bar shows the value of potential sales at each stage of the sales pipeline. </li>
<li><span class="helpButton">All Opportunities by Lead Source by Outcome</span>. A horizontal stacked bar chart that shows total opportunities for each lead source. Each bar is made up of multi-colored segments which represent the outcome proportions for that lead source.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Pipeline by Month by Outcome</span>. A stacked bar chart where each bar shows the total sales pipeline for each month. Each bar is made up of multi-colored segments which represent the outcome proportions for the pipeline in that month.</li> 
<li><span class="helpButton">All Opportunities by Lead Source</span>. A pie chart that shows the proportion of total sales opportunities for each lead source.</li>
